I am the co-organizer of the local Google Developer Group (ChapterName).  We are a volunteer-run organization focused on inspiring local developers who are interested in Mobile or Web technologies.
 We are currently looking to fill partnership positions for our upcoming season, and would love to determine if this opportunity is a good fit for your organization.

About our group:
	•	We are a group of volunteer developers and technologists, we are not directly affiliated with Google, and receive no financial support from them.
	•	We welcome diversity - our events are open to all skill levels, and various technologies.
	•	Our events are always free of charge, and completely community driven.
	•	Attendance varies by event.  We expect 25 - 35 people at each event.

Why should you support us?
	•	Connect with attendees on a high-level developer event.
	•	Brand yourself and your products as community-friendly.
	•	Endless thanks of the organizers and attendees.

	•	Conference - Food and drink for a bigger event (hackathon, or DevFest) (Cost: $200 - $1000)

The Direct Benefits we offer partners:
